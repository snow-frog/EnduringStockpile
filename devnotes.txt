DEVNOTES

-fixed geiger rad display system
-reworked shockwave annihilaiton zone
-added convars to control fallout length
-put radiation damage to CTakeDamageInfo again, put generic instead of radiation damage because of annoying flash
-need to fix airburst tracer collision with non-world
-fallout power now depends also on distance from ground (within 2000u)
-fixed decals on selectable-yield bombs
-need to add crater entity for surface bursts like fallout but with no buildup/raindown period, straight decay; size is fireballsize
-still need to figure out HUD
-optimise advanced_fallout maybe?
