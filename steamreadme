Realistic nuclear weapons, effects and radiation!
Version 1.8

SEE DISCUSSION FORUM FOR FULL DESCRIPTION!
DESCRIPTION:
This experimental mod was made to fix several shortcomings of Gbombs-based nukes. Among the issues were no small warheads meant for building (only gigantic early bombs and one-off test articles; no modern real-life deployed models) and somewhat unrealistic and arbitrary effects and power. I forked HBOMBS and started making some new entities, then i decided to go all the way and create an entire Full Realism nuke mod. This is a modification of HBOMBS, it's more of an expansion to it than a stand-alone mod for now, i never modded for Gmod before and didn't know Lua so i started from that. Much credit to it's author, this mod owes a lot to him. 

I made small yet life-size warheads in various yields including a few selectable-yield devices and 4 types of aircraft bombs. They use totally different code from regular nukes for more realistic effects, based on real-life research and scientific models. Adjustments have been made to the scale (1:12), duration and effects of explosions to keep things reasonable for Garry's Mod, yet their retain the right power scaling and effects of real-life, miles ahead of any other nuke mod currently out. 

The radiation model is also much more advanced than anything else out there, using inspiration from real-life effects of radiation. 

It is in constant work and will be continually updated for better realism.
This is my first mod, so please advise me of any bugs or errors and give me feedback. 
All deserved credit for the original code and models goes to their respective authors.

Dirty bomb - Conventional 500lb bomb but with radioactive material inside, creates lots of fallout
Nuclear waste barrel - A highly radioactive barrel of nuclear waste
Radioactive debris - Spicy rocks from an RBMK reactor
Nuclea reactor core - Highly radioactive core that can be powered up to massive levels of radiation, and potentially explode with catastrophic consequences
