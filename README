Build-friendly nukes with realistic effects
Version 3.0

This mod was made to fix several shortcomings of Gbombs-based nukes. Among the issues were no small warheads meant for building (only the full-sized bombs were available) and somewhat unrealistic and arbitrary effects and power. This is a modification of HBOMBS, which is itself a modification of Gbombs (if you're the author of either, contact me). I made small yet life-size warheads in various yields including a few selectable-yield devices and 4 types of aircraft bombs. They use significantly different code from regular nukes for more realistic effects, based on real-life research and scientific models. Some adjustments have been made to the scale (1:12), duration and effects of explosions to keep things reasonable for Garry's Mod yet still much more realistic than any other nuke mod.
This is my first mod, so please advise me of any bugs or errors and give me feedback. 
All deserved credit for the original code and models goes to their respective authors, i just copied their work and added my touch to it.

REQUIRED MODS:
Wiremod (for dial-a-yield bombs)
SProps
HBOMBS Base Pack
HBOMBS Material Pack
(tell me of any errors in case i forgot one)

FEATURES:
Bomb power: All bombs now have realistic blast and heat damage values from real data (ground burst), converted to Gmod units and scaled down 1:12. This means that the ranges for the effects of the explosion are realistic (enough), but divided by 12 from real life ranges. A bomb will have more powerful blast effects if it is exploded in the air, but produce no fallout.

Heat damage: The incinerate/ignite code in the bombs was completely redone. Now depending on how close you are from the bomb you will now either be burned slightly, be badly burned and maybe die, be burned to a crisp and die, or even be burned down to your bones. This depends on wether or not you are directly exposed to the heat flash, so hiding behind something will protect you from the flash burns as in real life. This also affects NPC's! Props close to the bomb can be charred (material change).

Blast damage: Blast damage now follows realistic ranges and power, props and entities very close to ground zero will simply vaporize. 

Dial-a-yield: Some warheads and bombs have a selectable yield option, which means you use wire to specify which mode of explosion you want.

Fallout: Fallout now decays over time as in real life; on a 2-minute timescale. This time was chosen so it's not too long for somewhat casual players. Compared to normal Gbombs fallout it lasts longer but drops in intensity quite quickly. An option will be added for long decay for those who want more realistic consequences. Airbursts (bombs exploding in the air) do not produce fallout. You are shielded from fallout if you stay inside a building or underground, or if you have a hazmat suit (up to a certain point!)

[Future update, v4.0] Prompt Radiation: When a nuclear bomb explodes, it instantly produces a powerful burst of radiation that can kill instantly as well as make people sick. This is more pronounced on smaller yield nukes, and a low-yield tactical Enhanced Radiation "Neutron" warhead which takes advantage of this effect has been added.

Note:
kt = kilotons (1000 tons of TNT)
mt = megatons (1000 kilotons)

In this mod you will find the following:
REN-1 warhead (1 kiloton) (visuals of Davy Crockett)
REN-10 warhead (10 kilotons) (visuals of Artillery shell)
REN-20 warhead (20 kilotons) (visuals of Fat Man)
REN-50 warhead (50 kilotons) (visuals of Ivy King)
REN-100 warhead (100 kilotons) (visuals of Gadget)
REN-250 warhead (250 kilotons) (visuals of Little Boy)
REN-500 warhead (500 kilotons) (visuals of Ivy Mike)
REN-1000 warhead (1 megaton) (visuals of Castle Bravo)
REN-5000 warhead (5 megatons) (visuals of Tsar Bomba)
REN-TAC warhead - Tactical warhead with selectable yield, Modes are 1=1kt, 2=10kt, 3=20kt, 4=50kt, default 1kt
REN-STRAT warhead - Strategic warhead with selectable yield, Modes are 1=100kt, 2=250kt, 3=500kt, 4=1mt, default 100kt
Mk7 Bomb (same thing as REN-10)
B61 Mod 7 bomb - Strategic bomb with selectable yield, Modes are 1=20kt, 2=50kt, 3=100kt, 4=250kt; default 100kt
B61 Mod 12 bomb - Tactical bomb with selectable yield, Modes are 1=1kt, 2=10kt, 3=20kt, 4=50kt, default 50kt
B83 bomb - Strategic bomb with selectable yield, Modes are 1=100kt, 2=250kt, 3=500kt, 4=1mt, default 1mt


FAQ
Q: Why are the warheads so tiny?
A: Because that's about how big they are in real life when you remove the bomb or missile warhead casing that holds them. They are meant to be easy to fit and weld into a contraption you make, such as a missile.

Q: Why are the bombs so small?
A: Because that's about how big they are in real life. You don't need a bomb the size of a freaking 18-wheeler trailer to reach megatons of power, it's not 1952 anymore.

Q: Why are they all just boring cylinders?
That's the point. They're small, handy little things you can fit on to anything you build. The bombs are there if you want something more exciting-looking.

Q: Why are the yields you give so scaled down? IE: why does the Tsar Bomba equivalent only say it's 5 megatons?
A: The Tsar Bomba in, say GBombs, is about visually equivalent to the real Little Boy. In effects, it's about really equivalent to just a 8-10 kiloton nuke in real life, and this insult to the Tsar angers the Lord of Megatons. The Tsar Bomba's power, 57 megatons (57,000 kilotons) is just mindboggling, like the wrath of god. The biggest GMod map i can find is about 860 meters diagonally, it would fit entirely within the fireball of a real 400 kiloton explosion. This is how big these things are. With the 1:12 scale i'm now using, 5 megatons is about as big as you can get without everything on the map being instantly vaporized (just barely). The new realistic power calculation give the bombs good and realistic power for our use.

Q: The bombs are overpowered!
A: Overpowered... realistic... nuclear... weapons... Think about that for a second. If you think there's something that could be adjusted for better effects and playability, tell me about it.

Q: Can you make the Tsar Bomba/This specific bomb/Some fantasy bomb?
A: No. That's not the point of this. 

Q: Any plans for the future?
This is my roadmap:
DONE: realistic effect ranges
DONE: more realistic flash-burn and ignition effects
DONE: dial-a-yield weapons (use wire to select the yield of the nuke)
DONE: realistic fallout with decay and dependent on ground/water or air burst
DONE: different blast/fire effect range dependent on wether it was ground or air burst (as IRL)
TO DO: rework blast shockwave
TO DO: icons!
TO DO: prompt radiation burst and neutron bombs
TO DO: make it all a standalone mod that doesn't need HBOMBS with a control panel including flash effect toggle
