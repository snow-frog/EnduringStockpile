DEVNOTES

-fixed geiger rad display system
-reworked shockwave annihilaiton zone
-added convars to control fallout length
-put radiation damage to CTakeDamageInfo again, put generic instead of radiation damage because of annoying flash
-need to fix airburst tracer collision with non-world
-fallout power now depends also on distance from ground (within 2000u)
-fixed decals on selectable-yield bombs
-added crater entity for surface bursts like fallout but with no buildup/raindown period, straight decay; size is fireballsize
-still need to figure out HUD
-dirty bomb
-autorun hooks and radiation think
-always spawn explosion at fireball ground
-permanent health loss from total exposure
-radioactive waste
-iodine/rad-X
-hazmat suit
-liquidator biorobot suit
-neutron activation?

Peak overpressure 	Maximum Wind Speed	
50 psi 	934 mph
20 psi 	502 mph
10 psi 	294 mph
5 psi 	163 mph
2 psi 	70 mph

As a general guide, city areas are completely destroyed by overpressures of 5 psi, with heavy damage extending out at least to the 3 psi contour.
These many different effects make it difficult to provide a simple rule of thumb for assessing the magnitude of injury produced by different blast intensities. A general guide is given below:
Overpressure 	Physical Effects
20 psi 	
    Heavily built concrete buildings are severely damaged or demolished.
10 psi 	
    Reinforced concrete buildings are severely damaged or demolished.
    Most people are killed.
5 psi 	
    Most buildings collapse.
    Injuries are universal, fatalities are widespread.
3 psi 	
    Residential structures collapse.
    Serious injuries are common, fatalities may occur.
1 psi 	
    Window glass shatters
    Light injuries from fragments occur.
